<h2>Design Process</h2>

* COVID-Tracker was designed to be a simple and easy to use website to allow anyone to find out how well a particular country is handling the COVID-19 Pandemic. 


<h2>Features</h2>

* Global Numbers - Global COVID-19 Statistics are shown in the middle of the website after the countrySearch feature.
* CountrySearch - COVID-Tracker allows users to search for specific countries and inquire on their COVID-19 statistics such as new cases and death rates.
* AlternatingInfo - The COVID-19 Statistics of 4 randomized countries will be shown at the bottom of the page.

<h3>Future Features</h3>

* COVID-Tracker will <b>eventually</b> include COVID-19 vaccination data as more and more countries roll out their respective vaccination programmes.
* Though it should be noted, all efforts at the moment will be spent on bug fixing and ensuring the longevity of COVID-Tracker before any more new features will be considered.

<h3>Devices and Resolutions Used</h3>

* Dell XPS 13 9300 1920x1200 

<h3>Browsers Used<h3>

* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Edge


<h3>Possible Problems</h3>

* Postman COVID19 API may be unreponsive at times due to the user refreshing the page multiple times. Though this scenario is unlikely, it should be noted.

* At times numbers provided by the Postman COVID19 API may be inaccurate. Countries with states in them and the Uk mostly have this issue. Unfortunately, I am not able to do much about that.
